What is our secret? Some good practices and mindset that we are applying.TDD, pair programming, CI/CD, TBD as our basic rules helped as to build an efficient and interesting tech application based on DDD and evolutionary architecture where data has a strong role to make decisions not only in business but in software. The key point is to be agile and deliver as soon as possible, failing fast and taking decisions in the last responsible moment, knowing that perfection is the enemy of good and having feedback and trust as normal behaviour within the team.We are building a powerful tech team and application and we want to share our secret with the community.About the speakersAna Jiménez, Software Engineer at Clevergy. With several years of experience in the IT sector working in different fields and consulting companies as a full stack developer. Ana, focused on tech teams’ ways of working and code best practices, is currently part of the Clevergy’s tech team.Juan López, CTO at Clevergy. He is a Software Engineer with 15 years of experience in the sector, working in diverse ecosystems and projects, from startups to large consulting companies, as a tech lead, project lead, and as a software engineer.

2023,Cáceres,Human vs AI: How to ship secure codeJoseph Katsioloudes (GitHub)EnglishMediumTalk descriptionArtificial intelligence (AI) is already acting as a copilot in our daily lives,"acting as a digital assistant or providing personalized experiences. Despite progress in many other areas, AI has historically stopped short of improving software development practices. Enter GitHub Copilot: the software industry’s first artificial intelligence solution that distills the collective knowledge of the world’s developers into an editor extension that suggests code in real time. ChatGPT then took the world by storm with its conversational capabilities and public reactions have been quite telling.This makes the process of building great software easier and faster, but what about more secure? In this session, we’ll demonstrate how GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT can help developers write more secure code through real-world use cases. The audience will come away with tips and best practices from the lessons we learned from experimenting with the tools.About the speakerJoseph Katsioloudes and his team at the GitHub Security Lab work at the forefront of Open Source Security that they shape every day through research and education. Joseph chose this career path because from a very young age, security was his own way to provide ethical and dedicated service to organisations and the society as a whole. He holds two engineering degrees, a Bachelors of Engineering in Computing from Imperial College London and a Masters in Cyber Security Engineering from the University of Warwick.His most recent contributions include video content made specifically for software developers interested in growing their security skillset, where he offers tips and simplifies security. Previous highlights include a combined of 20 talks and workshops in 2022 as a first-time speaker, a zero-day vulnerability for a Top 10 Cryptocurrency in 2018 as part of his university Thesis and open-source contributions to OSINT & Blockchain.",https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-caceres/program/ai-secure-code

2023,Cáceres,Getting Best Out of Team Exploratory Testing SessionsJulia Durán (Glofox)SpanishMediumTalk descriptionIn DevOps,"all of the tasks involved in the development and deployment of the code are highly automated. But there is a task manually performed that can provide us with very valuable insights. In the talk, Julia will present the Team Exploratory Testing Sessions, in which different roles within the team (Product Manager, Designer, Developers, Testers, SRE Team) are involved. All together will put themselves in the Tester’s shoes, testing at the same time the current feature in a common session. In that journey, led by the tester, they will identify not only issues but also possible improvements and proposals for future development, while learning because of the knowledge and expertise all of them share during the session.About the speakerLlevo trabajando más de 18 años en el sector tecnológico, de los cuales he dedicado más de 16 años al Testing. Recientemente le he dado un giro a mi carrera profesional, dejando las tareas de gestión y volviendo a realizar tareas de Testing, que es mi pasión!. Siempre trabajo con orientación a resultados y creo en el aprendizaje continuo. Para mejorar los proyectos en los que participo, me encanta experimentar y encontrar cambios que generen mejoras. Mi actitud y mentalidad positiva en todas las situaciones me permiten sacar lo mejor de las personas que trabajan conmigo.

2024,Cáceres,KubeVirt: Creando Máquinas Virtuales en un Clúster de KubernetesDiego Durán Rodríguez (Sngular)SpanishAllTalk descriptionIntroducciónLa virtualización y la orquestación de contenedores son dos tecnologías fundamentales en el mundo de la infraestructura de TI moderna. Kubernetes,"como orquestador de contenedores líder, ha revolucionado la forma en que desplegamos y gestionamos aplicaciones. Sin embargo, ¿qué sucede cuando necesitamos ejecutar cargas de trabajo tradicionales, como máquinas virtuales (VM)? Aquí es donde entra en juegoKubeVirt.¿Qué es KubeVirt?KubeVirtes una extensión de Kubernetes que permite a los administradores y desarrolladores ejecutar máquinas virtuales junto con contenedores en un mismo clúster. En lugar de tener dos plataformas separadas (una para contenedores y otra para VM), KubeVirt unifica ambos mundos. Esto es especialmente útil cuando se trata de migrar aplicaciones heredadas o cuando se requiere una mayor flexibilidad en la elección de la tecnología de implementación.Beneficios de KubeVirt1. Consolidación de recursosAl combinar máquinas virtuales y contenedores en un solo clúster, se pueden aprovechar los recursos de manera más eficiente. No es necesario mantener dos infraestructuras separadas, lo que reduce la complejidad y los costos operativos.2. FlexibilidadKubeVirt permite a los equipos de operaciones y desarrollo elegir la mejor tecnología para cada carga de trabajo. Las aplicaciones basadas en contenedores pueden coexistir con aplicaciones heredadas en el mismo entorno.3. Integración con herramientas de KubernetesKubeVirt se integra perfectamente con las herramientas y características nativas de Kubernetes, como el escalado automático y la gestión de recursos. Esto facilita la administración y el monitoreo de las máquinas virtuales.Casos de uso1. Migración gradualLas organizaciones que desean modernizar sus aplicaciones pueden utilizar KubeVirt para migrar gradualmente las máquinas virtuales a un entorno basado en contenedores. Esto permite una transición sin problemas sin afectar la disponibilidad de las aplicaciones.2. Desarrollo y pruebasLos desarrolladores pueden usar KubeVirt para crear entornos de desarrollo y pruebas que incluyan tanto VM como contenedores. Esto facilita la validación de aplicaciones antes de implementarlas en producción.3. Aplicaciones heredadasLas aplicaciones heredadas que no se pueden refactorizar fácilmente pueden ejecutarse en máquinas virtuales dentro de un clúster de Kubernetes. KubeVirt proporciona una solución para mantener estas aplicaciones mientras se adopta gradualmente la arquitectura de contenedores.Mejores prácticas1. Planificación de recursosEs importante asignar recursos adecuados a las máquinas virtuales y contenedores. KubeVirt utiliza las mismas políticas de escalado que Kubernetes, por lo que es fundamental comprender cómo funciona la escalado de recursos.2. MonitoreoUtiliza herramientas de monitoreo para supervisar tanto para las máquinas virtuales como para los contenedores. Esto ayudará a identificar cuellos de botella y optimizar el rendimiento.3. SeguridadAplica las mismas prácticas de seguridad a las máquinas virtuales que a los contenedores. Esto incluye la segmentación de red, el acceso a volúmenes y la autenticación.About the speakerAmante de la automatización de tareas y optimización de procesos en el ciclo de vida del software desde hace más de 10 años. Mi primer contacto con una línea de comandos fue a los 7 años con un IBM 386DX, actualmente trabajo como SRE & DevOps en Sngular y siempre evolucionando con mi laboratorio formado por 24 SBC.",https://devopsdays.org/events/2024-caceres/program/kubevirt
